# Create-a-Sentinel-Workspace

Now it's time to create our Sentinel workspace and we will do that by searching for <b>Microsoft Sentinel</b>.

We will click on <b>Create</b>.

What you see is that resource creation differs a bit because what you currently see is that we need to add Sentinel to a log analytics workspace. For that we could either create a new workspace but we don't have to that because we already created a log analytics workspace, so we will be selecting that one (DemoLA) and we add Sentinel to this log analytics workspace by clicking <b>Add</b>. Then we wait for the deployment to succeed.

After it's deployed, most will get a free trial. You will get 1 free month for both Sentinel and Log Analytics but only 10 gigabytes per day, if you acceed the 10 gigabytes you will be charged the difference.
